I will be documenting whatever I fuck around with, whatever I learn here.

# Documenting.

I understand the importance of documenting. If I donâ€™t write down, document my thoughts, I will lose pretty and nuanced things to time. Also, my writing is getting worse and worse day by day. I hate that and this is an attempt to change it.

Apart from technical computer sciency stuff, I will also try to lay down my raw thoughts on some other subjects.

Also, I plan to maintain sort of a personal journal of things I am going through and feeling @ https://personal.lolwierd.ml (ofc no one can access it but me).

I also feel like this would be the best way to showcase my skills and what I learned.

Now all that's left to see is how long I keep this up ðŸ™‚.
