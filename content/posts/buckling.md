> All of this is just an observation. Nothing more. I do not have the necessary hard empirical knowledge to back this up. Nor do I have a god enough grasp of vocabulary to convey what I want to precisely. So, I want this to be a ‘live post’. I will keep updating it as I learn new things which confirm or deny assumptions and inferences made in this post.

We are moving too fast, we are improving so fast that rest of humanity cannot keep up.

I think that’s an issue we have to deal with and not enough people are thinking about it.

In order to be an expert in any field right now, we have to start too early. We have too much to learn for us to work at the forefront of any field. This threshold will keep on getting higher and higher with each passing decade.

This need to start early to be the best in one’s field is very bad in my opinion. I do not know if children possess the required maturity to understanding which field they like. I were to guess, I think they do not. I don’t think this is good. (if true)

Also I understand not everyone is suited to be the very best (or even in contention to be the best). But as the ‘hardness’ to get there increases, I think less and less people would be the very best and our ‘improvement’ will slow down.

I do not know the time frame when this will happen, nor do I know for sure if this will happen. All I know is, this seems like to be the logical outcome.

One way to solve this, is through natural evolution. We need to improve our learning and retaining rate, and also need to improve the skill which helps us take a step back and view things as a whole. I don’t know what that’s called. But that skill is very necessary when learning about something in depth, from my experience. I am very certain that these are not the only skills we need.

Another way is to feed the bare minimum amount of information directly to our brain, when we are a baby. This sounds scary, but I think this is a more practical solution then waiting for evolution to kick in. I think some sort of brain interface would be the next big thing.
