Don’t feel the need to win. Don’t feel the need to be perfect.

> The thing is Results are never guaranteed There are a lot of things that aren’t under my control And these factors will limit how much I can achieve, and how much I can get Instead of being sad about it I should focus on doing my work because then only, I will be able to do the best I can possibly do. ~Nikhil
