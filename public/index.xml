      <title>Two ways to live</title>

      <description>As far as I understand, there are 2 ways to live.
With ambition and without ambition. With dreams, like every other shonen protagonist and like Denji.
I am halfway through Chainsaw Man, and it has moved me to an extent where I am forced to rethink how I view my life as a whole.
This is not a post analyzing or breaking apart Chainsaw Man. I would hate that.
This is rather an exploration of how I am living my life right now, and how this beautiful piece of literature forced me to rethink that.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t feel the need to win. Don&amp;rsquo;t feel the need to be perfect.
Whenever you feel stuck, or overwhelmed, go back to the basics.
 If you have a sense of entitlement to the result, then lack of it will beat your spirits and you&amp;rsquo;ll obsess more over it than your work And even worse trap is doing nothing because results aren&amp;rsquo;t guaranteed. ~Nikhil
  The thing is Results are never guaranteed There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of things that aren&amp;rsquo;t under my control And these factors will limit how much I can achieve, how much I can get Instead being sad about it I should focus on doing my work because then only, I will be able to do the best I can possibly do.</description>

      <title>How I made these Blogs</title>

      <description>I wanted to have my own blog for quite some time. Originally my plan was to build it in ruby using Jekyll or Ruby On Rails. But I gave up on Jekyll due to me not finding good enough themes. I was NOT going to build it from scratch. I do not yet possess the needed patience and design skills to pull it off (read as, I was not serious enough).</description>

      <description>I will be documenting whatever I fuck around with, whatever I learn here.
Documenting. I understand the importance of documenting. If I don&amp;rsquo;t write down, document my thoughts, I will lose pretty and nuanced things to time. Also my writing is getting worse and worse day by day. I hate that and this is an attempt to change it.
Apart from technical computer sciency stuff, I will try to lay down my raw thoughts on some other subjects as well.</description>
